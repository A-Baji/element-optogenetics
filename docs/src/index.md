# Element Optogenetics

DataJoint Element for managing data from optogenetics experiments. DataJoint Elements 
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience 
experiments.  Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with 
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a 
fully functional pipeline.
