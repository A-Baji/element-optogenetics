# Element Optogenetics

DataJoint Element for Optogenetics research. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize
and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments.  Each Element is
a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database
tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.
