# Roadmap

This Element stores key information about optogenetic stimulus protocols used during 
experimental sessions.

- [x] Stimulus parameters (waveform properties, wavelength, power, duration, etc.)
- [x] Implant location of the optical fiber
- [x] Stimulus pulse generator
- [x] Stimulus start and end times during an experimental session

Further development of this Element is community driven.  Upon user requests and based 
on guidance from the Scientific Steering Group we will add further features to this 
Element.
