## Optogenetic Research

The seminal 2005 paper[^1] by Karl Deisseroth and colleagues established a strategy for
using light (*opto-*) to directly regulate the activation of genetically modified
(*-genetics*) neurons 
([Boyden et al., Nature Neuroscience 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1525){:target="_blank"}). 
By incorporating genes from photosensitive algae, neurons become sensitive to different 
wavelengths for either excitation or inhibition. Scientists now use this technology to 
draw more direct causal links between the activity of neuronal populations and 
corresponding animal behavior.
