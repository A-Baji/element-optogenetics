## Optogenetic Research

The seminal 2005 paper[^1] by Karl Deisseroth and colleagues established a strategy for
using light (*opto-*) to directly regulate the activation of genetically modified
(*-genetics*) neurons. By incorporating genes from photosensitive algae, neurons become
sensitive to different wavelengths for either excitation or inhibition.
Scientists now use this technology to draw more direct
causal links between the activity of neuronal populations and corresponding animal behavior.
